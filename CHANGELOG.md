- Logging examples for SimpleLogger and Log4j

### Changed
- HttpClient interface to allow SDK users to inject HTTP headers or implement an HTTP proxy by extending 
DefaultHttpClient (a proxy sample is provided in the README)
- Removed ShouldRetry and CalcBackoff interfaces and replaced with HttpClient interface methods. You can now customize 
shouldRetry or calcBackoff using the same method as proxy or request header injection (i.e. extend DefaultHttpClient).

### Fixed
- Several deserialization issues with Sights
- Share builders were improperly setting share type
- The rate-limit/backoff retry scenario did not work if the request contained a body because the body stream had not 
been reset prior to the retry (PUT/POST).  The Apache HttpClient will raise a NonRepeatableRequestException that is now 
handled by the SDK (which resets the body content stream).
- There is a keep-alive race condition that exists when the server disconnects idle connections. If a request is made 
in the window in between when the server has disconnected, but before the client has detected the disconnect, it looks 
to the client as if the server returned a blank HTTP status line. Idempotent methods (PUT, DELETE, GET) are retried 
automatically. A POST request will not be retried automatically by the Apache HttpClient. This fix will handle 
NoHttpResponseException exceptions and retry POSTs automatically after resetting the body content stream.


## [2.2.3] - 2017-12-7
### Added
- New `attachFile` overloads that accept an `inputStream`
- Constructors that accept object Id for Cell, Row, and Column
- Additional options when publishing Sheets or Reports

### Changed

## [2.2.1] - 2017-02-13
### Changed
- Fixed flags for Folder/Workspace Copy or Remap

## [2.2.0] - 2017-08-02
### Added
- Logging
- Chained setters
- Sheet.ProjectSettings
- First class support for `PredecessorList` as an implementation of `ObjectValue`

    This is a breaking change if you use PredecessorList
    
    This code sample shows how to update PredecessorList after updating to 2.2.0:
    ```Java
      Predecessor predecessor = new Predecessor();
      predecessor.setRowId(265775251515268L);         // Id of row to depend on
      predecessor.setType("FS");

      PredecessorList pl = new PredecessorList(new ArrayList<Predecessor>(Arrays.asList(predecessor)));

      Cell cell = new Cell();
      cell.setColumnId(7984328786372484L);           // Id of 'Predecessors' column
      cell.setObjectValue(pl);

      Row row = new Row();
      row.setId(6146602304857988L);                  // Id of row to update
      row.setCells(new ArrayList<Cell>(Arrays.asList(cell)));
      ArrayList<Row> rows = new ArrayList<Row>(Arrays.asList(row));

      smartsheet.sheetResources().rowResources().updateRows(3102146867554180L, rows);  // Id of sheet
    ```
